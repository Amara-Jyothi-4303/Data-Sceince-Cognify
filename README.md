Data exploration is the preliminary phase of examining data to understand its structure, identify patterns, and spot anomalies through visualizations and summary statistics. Descriptive analytics is a statistical interpretation used to analyze historical data to identify patterns and relationships. Descriptive analytics seeks to describe an event, phenomenon, or outcome. It helps understand what has happened in the past and provides businesses the perfect base to track trends. Feature engineering, in data science, refers to manipulation — addition, deletion, combination, mutation — of your data set to improve machine learning model training, leading to better performance and greater accuracy.
